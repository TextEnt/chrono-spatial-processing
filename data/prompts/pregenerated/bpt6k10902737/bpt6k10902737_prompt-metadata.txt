Look at the following JSON object describing a theatre play in French (XVII century); the `metadata` property contains basic information about the play (author, title, publication date).

INPUT:
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "author": "Larivey, Pierre de",
    "title": "Trois Comedies des six dernieres de Pierre de Larivey, champenois. A l'imitation des anciens Grecs, Latins & Modernes Italiens",
    "publication_date": "1611",
    "document_id": "bpt6k10902737"
  }
}
```

Your role is to predict the location and historical period in which the action of the play is set. 

KEY RULES:
- Predict the timespan and not the precise and exact date of the period where the play could have taken place
- Do not write an introduction or summary 
- The response must contain only valid JSON
- The values in the JSON "timeframe_start" and "timeframe_end" should always be a single valid ISO date in the form YYYY-MM-DD
- if the provided information is not sufficient to determine historical period and/or location, the following values can be set to `None`: `period`, `timeframe_start`, `timeframe_end`, `location`, `location_qid`

Return your response and the underlying reasoning as a JSON object with the following structure:
```json
{
    "period": "The historical period in which the play could have taken place",
    "period_reasoning": "The reasoning the model used to identify the historical period",
    "timeframe_start": "The ISO-formatted start value of the historical period",
    "timeframe_end": "The ISO-formatted start value of the historical period",
    "location": "The geographic location where the action of the play takes place",
    "location_reasoning": "The reasoning the model used to identify the geographic location",
    "location_qid": "The Wikidata QID of the identified location"
}
```
