PREDICTION:
```json
{prediction_json}
```

REFERENCE:
```json

```

ASSESSMENT RULES:
1. Score for period string (`score_period_string`)
- compare the prediction (field ``) against the reference (field ``)
- assign 1 point if ...
- assign 0.5 points if ...
- assign 0 points if ...
- store this score in the field `score_period_string` of your output JSON document 

2. Score for period interval (`score_period_interval`)
- compare the prediction (field ``) against the reference (field ``)
- assign 1 point if ...
- assign 0.5 points if ...
- assign 0 points if ...
- store this score in the field `score_period_interval` of your output JSON document 

3. Score for location string (`score_location_string`)
- compare the prediction (field ``) against the reference (field ``)
- assign 1 point if ...
- assign 0.5 points if ...
- assign 0 points if ...
- store this score in the field `score_location_string` of your output JSON document 

4. Score for location QID (`score_location_qid`)
- compare the prediction (field ``) against the reference (field ``)
- assign 1 point if ...
- assign 0.5 points if ...
- assign 0 points if ...
- store this score in the field `score_location_qid` of your output JSON document 

Return your assessment and the underlying reasoning as a JSON object with the following structure:
```json

    "score_period_string": "The score for the period string; it must be a value between 0-1",
    "score_period_interval": "The score for the period interval; it must be a value between 0-1",
    "score_location_string": "The score for the location string; it must be a value between 0-1",
    "score_location_qid": "The score for the location QID; it must be a value between 0-1",
