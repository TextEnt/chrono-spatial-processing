Additionally, words like 'la Victore \u00e0 vos armes' (victory by your arms) suggest a military context, and references to '\u00c9tats' (states) and 'Ennemis' (enemies) point to conflicts between city-states or kingdoms, common in ancient Greece. The setting seems to involve royal or noble characters in a classical context, fitting the tragic genre of 17th century French neoclassical theater which often drew from ancient Greek and Roman sources.\",\n    \"timeframe_start\": \"-600\",\n    \"timeframe_end\": \"-200\",\n    \"location\": \"Ancient Sparta\",\n    \"location_reasoning\": \"The name 'Cleomene' strongly suggests a connection to Sparta, as several Spartan kings bore this name (Cleomenes I, II, and III). The play's themes of succession, conflict between states, and military victory are consistent with Spartan history. Classical French tragedies frequently used ancient Sparta as a setting for exploring themes of duty, honor, and political intrigue.\",\n    \"location_qid\": \"Q5780\"\n}",
