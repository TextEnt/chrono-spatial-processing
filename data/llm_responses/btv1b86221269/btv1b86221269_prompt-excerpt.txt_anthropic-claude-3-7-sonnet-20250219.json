Additionally, classical mythology was a common source for 17th century French theatre. The character name 'Diane' in the excerpt strongly suggests the play is set in classical antiquity or draws from classical mythology.\",\n    \"timeframe_start\": \"-100\",\n    \"timeframe_end\": \"100\",\n    \"location\": \"Ancient Greece or Ancient Rome\",\n    \"location_reasoning\": \"The reference to 'Diane' (Diana in Latin) suggests a setting in the classical world. Given that Rotrou was writing in 17th century France, and French dramatists of this period often set their plays in classical settings, particularly ancient Greece or Rome, the play is likely set in one of these locations. Additionally, the name 'Orante' mentioned in the excerpt sounds like it could be a Latinized or Hellenized name fitting this setting. However, without more specific textual evidence about the exact location, I cannot determine whether it's specifically set in Greece or Rome.\",\n    \"location_qid\": None\n}",
