While Paris is mentioned more frequently, those mentions appear to be related to publication information rather than the setting of the play itself. Character names like 'Bernadille', 'Octave', 'Beatrix', and references to places like 'Venise' suggest an Italian setting, which was common for French comedies of this period. The name 'Lope' might indicate Spanish influence, but considering all evidence, Venice seems the most likely setting.\",\n    \"location_qid\": \"Q641\"\n}",
