The characters have Greek-sounding names (Lycoris, Melindor, Cyrene), and there are references to mythological elements like 'Nymphes marines' (sea nymphs), 'Nochers' (boatmen/sailors in classical context), and Venus. The mention of 'Le Dieu de la Lumi\u00e8re' (likely Apollo, the god of light) also suggests a classical Greek setting.\",\n    \"timeframe_start\": \"-800\",\n    \"timeframe_end\": \"-323\",\n    \"location\": \"Rural Greece or mythological Greek landscape\",\n    \"location_reasoning\": \"This appears to be a pastoral play with Greek character names and classical mythology references. The setting involves shepherds and shepherdesses ('Berg\u00e8re' appears frequently), typical of pastoral literature. While 'Paris' and 'Seine' are mentioned among top places, these are likely references rather than the setting itself, as the pastoral genre typically depicts an idealized rural Greek landscape. The mention of 'Cyth\u00e8re' (Cythera), an island associated with Venus/Aphrodite in Greek mythology, further supports a Greek setting.\",\n    \"location_qid\": \"Q35\"\n}",
