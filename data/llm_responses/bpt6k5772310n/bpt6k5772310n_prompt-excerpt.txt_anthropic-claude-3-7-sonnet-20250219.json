The dialogue mentions Pirithous, who was a legendary king in Greek mythology and friend of Theseus. The play appears to be depicting the mythological story of Ariadne, which took place in Crete and possibly other parts of Greece. The mention of 'un grand Roi' (a great King) in the text reinforces this setting.\",\n    \"location_qid\": \"Q34374\"\n}",
