The language is French, and the style of character names and dialogue appears consistent with French theatrical conventions of that period. Since most French plays of this period were set in contemporary times or the recent past, it's reasonable to assume the action is set in the 17th century.\",\n    \"timeframe_start\": \"1600\",\n    \"timeframe_end\": \"1650\",\n    \"location\": \"Paris\",\n    \"location_reasoning\": \"Paris is mentioned five times in the text according to the places data. It appears to be the central location where the action takes place. Paris is referenced as having 'mille Soleils' (a thousand suns) and as a place with 'grand nombre' (large numbers of people). Characters refer to Paris as a setting where social interactions occur, suggesting it is the primary location of the play.\",\n    \"location_qid\": \"Q90\"\n}",
