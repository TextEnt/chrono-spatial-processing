The play 'Clorinde' was published in 1637, during the reign of Louis XIII, a period of French Baroque theater. Given the conventions of the time, Rotrou's plays often had contemporary settings or were set in the recent past, suggesting a Renaissance or early 17th century setting.\",\n    \"timeframe_start\": \"1550\",\n    \"timeframe_end\": \"1637\",\n    \"location\": \"France or Italy\",\n    \"location_reasoning\": \"The name 'Clorinde' suggests Italian origins (derived from 'Clorinda', a character in Tasso's 'Jerusalem Delivered'). Rotrou was known to adapt Italian plots and commedia dell'arte traditions. However, as a French playwright writing for French audiences, he often transposed settings to France or maintained the Italian setting while adapting to French tastes.
