{
    "period": "Ancient Babylonian Period",
    "period_reasoning": "The title of the play, 'La mort de Baltazar, roy de Babilone', indicates that it is centered around the death of King Belshazzar. Historically, Belshazzar was a king of Babylon during the Neo-Babylonian Empire, specifically known from biblical accounts in the Book of Daniel. This situates the play's action during the late period of the Neo-Babylonian Empire.",
    "timeframe_start": "-550",
    "timeframe_end": "-539",
    "location": "Babylon",
    "location_reasoning": "The title explicitly mentions 'Babilone', which is Babylon in French, indicating that the action takes place in the city of Babylon. Given the historical context of Belshazzar's reign, it aligns with this location.",
    "location_qid": "Q1070"
}


This reasoning determines that the play likely depicts events during the final years of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, specifically around 550-539 BCE, when King Belshazzar ruled Babylon. The geographic focus is on the city of Babylon itself.
