    "period": null,
    "period_reasoning": "The excerpt references characters Enée (Aeneas) and Didon (Dido), who are figures from Roman mythology. These characters are associated with ancient Rome, suggesting a setting in antiquity. However, the play's title 'Tite et Titus, ou Critique sur les Berenices' indicates a reference to Roman history or culture, possibly during the time of Emperors Titus and Domitian, which would place it around 1st century C.E. The exact period is not explicitly stated in the excerpt.",
    "timeframe_start": "-753",
    "timeframe_end": "96",
    "timeframe_reasoning": "The timeframe from -753 to 96 covers the founding of Rome (traditionally dated to 753 B.C.) and extends through the Roman Empire, including the reigns of Emperors Titus (79-81 C.E.) and Domitian (81-96 C.E.). This period aligns with the historical context suggested by the characters Enée and Didon, as well as the reference to Berenice, who could be linked to a later Roman or Hellenistic context.",
    "location": null,
    "location_reasoning": "The excerpt does not provide specific geographic details about where the play is set. While it references ancient Roman figures, this alone is insufficient to pinpoint a precise location within the vast expanse of the Roman Empire or its historical territories.",
