The reference to 'Berenice' in both the title ('Critique sur les Berenices') and the excerpt suggests this is about the historical relationship between Emperor Titus and Queen Berenice of Cilicia, a famous love story from Ancient Rome. The mention of 'En√©e' (Aeneas) and 'Didon' (Dido) in the excerpt also refers to classical mythology and the founding myths of Rome.",
