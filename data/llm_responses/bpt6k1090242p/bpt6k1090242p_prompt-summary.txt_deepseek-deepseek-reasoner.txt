    "period": "Roman Empire",
    "period_reasoning": "The play references historical figures Titus and Berenice, who were associated with the Roman Empire (1st century CE). The title and characters suggest a focus on Roman-era narratives, though filtered through a 17th-century French critique.",

    "location": "Rome",
    "location_reasoning": "Titus was a Roman emperor, and Berenice was a client queen of Rome. While the play's meta-commentary involves the mythological Parnassus, the core narrative likely centers on Rome. Mentions of Rome in the top_5_places further support this.",
