The excerpt mentions 'Cavaliers' and uses formal French expressions like 'Messieurs excuse-nous si l'importunit\u00e9'. Additionally, the play title is in French and it was published in France in 1637, strongly suggesting the setting is also France. The mention of a 'Batelier' (boatman) suggests a scene near water, possibly a river in France.\",\n    \"location_qid\": \"Q142\"\n}",
