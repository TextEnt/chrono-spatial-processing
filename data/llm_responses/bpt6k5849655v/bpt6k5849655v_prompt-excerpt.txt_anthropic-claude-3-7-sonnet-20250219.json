The title referencing Pluton (Pluto, god of the underworld) indicates classical mythological elements, but this was common in 17th century French drama. Without clear historical markers indicating a different time period, it's most reasonable to assume the action is set in the author's contemporary period.\",\n    \"timeframe_start\": \"1600\",\n    \"timeframe_end\": \"1649\",\n    \"location\": \"France\",\n    \"location_reasoning\": \"The play is written in French and was published in 17th century France. The character names in the excerpt, while unusual (possibly anagrams or stylized names), appear to be French in nature. The scenographic indication 'SC\u00c8NE QUATRI\u00c8ME' follows French theatrical conventions of the period.
