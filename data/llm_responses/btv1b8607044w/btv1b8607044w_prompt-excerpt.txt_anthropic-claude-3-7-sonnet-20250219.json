The themes of tyrannical love (as suggested by the title 'L'Amour tirannique'), fate, and moral dilemmas are common in classical tragedies. The language and themes suggest a setting in antiquity, consistent with the neoclassical French theatrical tradition of the 17th century, which often based tragedies on Greek and Roman stories.\",\n    \"timeframe_start\": \"-500\",\n    \"timeframe_end\": \"500\",\n    \"location\": \"Ancient Greece or Rome\",\n    \"location_reasoning\": \"The play was written in 17th century France by Georges de Scud\u00e9ry, and French classical theater of this period typically set tragedies in ancient Greece or Rome. The reference to 'Destins' (Fates) points to classical mythology, and the moral conflict portrayed (between duty to family versus love) was a common theme in classical settings. However, without more specific references to actual historical places or people in the excerpt, I cannot determine if it's specifically set in Greece or Rome.\",\n    \"location_qid\": \"None\"\n}",
