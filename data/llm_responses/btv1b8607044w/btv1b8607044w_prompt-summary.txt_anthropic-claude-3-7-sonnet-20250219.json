Polix\u00e8ne/Polyx\u00e8ne is likely a reference to Polyxena, a daughter of King Priam of Troy in Greek mythology. Tiridate and Tigrane are names associated with ancient Armenian/Persian rulers. The mention of 'Tyran' (tyrant) and discussions of thrones, poison, and royal intrigue suggest a setting in classical antiquity. The reference to Rome and Athens as comparisons also points to a classical setting.\",\n    \"timeframe_start\": \"-600\",\n    \"timeframe_end\": \"-300\",\n    \"location\": \"Ancient Greece or Anatolia/Persian Empire\",\n    \"location_reasoning\": \"The character names suggest a setting in either Ancient Greece or the Persian Empire (including Armenia). Polix\u00e8ne/Polyx\u00e8ne is a Greek name (associated with Troy), while names like Tiridate, Or\u00f4mane, and Tigrane have Persian or Armenian origins. The mention of 'Tibre' (Tiber) and 'Troie' (Troy) in the top places, alongside Greece and Rome, reinforces the classical Mediterranean/Near Eastern setting. The play appears to be set in a region that could be part of the Persian Empire or Greek influence during classical antiquity.\",\n    \"location_qid\": \"None\"\n}",
