The language in the excerpt uses formal, archaic speech patterns typical of nobility or high-status characters. The mention of 'fers' (chains/irons) and captivity suggests the capture of noble individuals, which was common in corsair/pirate narratives. Given the publication date (1663) and the tragi-comic genre, this most likely depicts corsair activity in the Mediterranean or Caribbean during the 17th century, corresponding to the early part of the Golden Age of Piracy.\",\n    \"timeframe_start\": \"1600\",\n    \"timeframe_end\": \"1650\",\n    \"location\": \"Mediterranean Sea\",\n    \"location_reasoning\": \"The term 'corsaire' in the title specifically refers to privateers who operated with legal authorization, most commonly in the Mediterranean Sea during this period. The formal language and references to nobility in the excerpt align with the Mediterranean corsair context, where Ottoman, Barbary, and European corsairs frequently captured nobility and high-status individuals. The Mediterranean was the primary theater for corsair activity during the early 17th century, when European powers and Ottoman/Barbary states engaged in naval conflict and privateering.\",\n    \"location_qid\": \"Q4918\"\n}",
