The presence of characters like 'LE SATYRE' also points to a classical pastoral tradition, common in 17th century French theater that evoked an idealized ancient world.\",\n    \"timeframe_start\": \"-800\",\n    \"timeframe_end\": \"-300\",\n    \"location\": \"Rural France\",\n    \"location_reasoning\": \"The play is described as a 'Pastorale' (pastoral) which typically takes place in an idealized rural setting.

The characters include shepherds and shepherdesses ('Bergers', 'Berg\u00e8res') and references to 'belles campagnes' (beautiful countryside).
