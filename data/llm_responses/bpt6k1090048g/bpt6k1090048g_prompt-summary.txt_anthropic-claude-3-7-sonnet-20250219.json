References to 'the Gods' in plural form suggest a polytheistic society, which aligns with ancient Mesopotamian culture.

The reference to the Tigris River ('Tigre') is significant as it was one of the two major rivers of Mesopotamia. The classical setting combined with these Middle Eastern elements strongly suggests Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) as the location. The name structures and mythological references (like Zephyr) suggest a blend of classical and Middle Eastern elements common in 17th century French dramatic interpretations of ancient settings.\",\n    \"location_qid\": \"Q11761\"\n}",
