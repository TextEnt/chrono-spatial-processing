The metadata only indicates that it was published by Chevreau Urbain (a known French dramatist) during a time when plays were performed on stage or as part of courtly entertainment before modern theaters emerged.\n\nThe title also suggests we are looking for something possibly related with 17th century theatrical trends such as the Baroque period which started approximately in early to mid-1600's. Still, without any specific clues about location from this snippet there is not enough evidence available that would allow us to confidently narrow down a time frame or geographical setting.\n\nIf you have access to more of Chevreau Urbain\u2019s work we could look for other contextual references which might help identify the play and possibly its historical period.",
