Given the publication date and the genre of tragicomedy that became popular during the Renaissance and early modern period, it's reasonable to estimate the setting is somewhere within the 16th to early 17th century.\",\n    \"timeframe_start\": \"1550\",\n    \"timeframe_end\": \"1640\",\n    \"location\": \"France\",\n    \"location_reasoning\": \"The play is written in French by a French author (Urbain Chevreau) during the 17th century.
