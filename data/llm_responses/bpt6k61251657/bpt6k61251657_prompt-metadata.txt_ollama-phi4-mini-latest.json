The author's name and title suggest that they may have been active during the French Renaissance (16th-17th centuries), but there are no explicit references in the metadata field indicating when exactly urban Chevreau composed his work \"L'Innocent exil\u00e9 . Tragi-com\u00e9die.\" Furthermore, as a tragedy comedy genre was popularized by William Shakespeare and other playwrights of that era who were based primarily in England (and later France), it is difficult to pinpoint an exact location. Since the author name appears to be misspelled (\"Chevreau\" instead of \"Chavreau\"), further research would need to confirm whether this play was written during a specific historical period and/or its geographic setting.\n\nWithout additional context, such as information on urban Chevreau's nationality or where he composed his work while living in France (if indeed that's the case), we cannot make assumptions about when it might have been created nor pinpoint an exact place of action for this play. If you can provide more details like these, a better prediction could be made.",
