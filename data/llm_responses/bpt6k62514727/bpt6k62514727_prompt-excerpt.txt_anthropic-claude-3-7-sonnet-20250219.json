French theatrical comedies of this period typically depicted contemporary settings, especially those performed at the prestigious H\u00f4tel de Bourgogne (mentioned in the title). The character names (Capitan, Galafre) and dialogue style suggest a contemporary 17th century setting rather than a historical one.\",\n    \"timeframe_start\": \"1600\",\n    \"timeframe_end\": \"1699\",\n    \"location\": \"Paris, France\",\n    \"location_reasoning\": \"The play was performed at the 'Th\u00e9\u00e2tre royal de l'Hostel de Bourgogne' which was located in Paris. This was one of the most important theaters in 17th century France. The mention of a 'Capitan' character (a stock character type in 17th century French comedy) further suggests a Parisian setting, as these theatrical conventions were popular in urban French theater. While the excerpt is limited, the urban setting implied by characters like a 'Bouqueti\u00e8re' (flower seller) suggests a city environment, most likely Paris where the play was performed.\",\n    \"location_qid\": \"Q90\"\n}",
