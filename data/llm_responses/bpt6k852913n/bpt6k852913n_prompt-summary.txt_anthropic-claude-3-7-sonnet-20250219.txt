    "period": "17th century France",
    "period_reasoning": "The play was published in 1678 according to the metadata, and as a French comedy from the 17th century, it would most likely be set in the same time period. The characters, language, and social context (mention of marriage arrangements, aristocratic titles, etc.) are consistent with 17th century French society.",
    "timeframe_start": "1650",
    "timeframe_end": "1700",
    "location": "Paris and Senlis, France",
    "location_reasoning": "Several locations are mentioned in the text, with Senlis and Paris being the most significant. Senlis appears twice in the 'related_sentences' and is listed as the top place. Paris is also mentioned along with Luxembourg and Tuileries (which are in Paris). One character states 'J'arrive de Senlis' (I arrive from Senlis) to get married, suggesting movement between these locations. The action likely takes place primarily in Paris with Senlis as a secondary location.",
