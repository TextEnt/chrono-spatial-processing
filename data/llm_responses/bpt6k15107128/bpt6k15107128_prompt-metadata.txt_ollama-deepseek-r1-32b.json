  "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the period and location for Racine's play Athalie. Let me start by recalling what I know about this play.\n\nAthalie is a tragedy written by Jean Racine in 1691. The title mentions it's based on the Holy Scriptures, specifically from the Bible. The story revolves around Athaliah, who was the queen of Judah. From what I remember, she ruled after the death of her son King Ahaziah and tried to eliminate all possible successors.\n\nSince the play is based on biblical events, the setting should be during the time when the events in the Bible took place. Athaliah's reign was around the 9th century BCE. So the timeframe would start from that period. The events probably end with her overthrow, which also happened in the same general time frame.\n\nAs for the location, the play is set in Judah, which is part of modern-day Israel and Palestine. The main city involved is Jerusalem, where Athaliah was ruling. I should check if there's a specific Wikidata QID for Judah or Jerusalem from that historical period.\n\nSo putting it all together, the timeframe starts around -842 BCE when Athaliah took power after Ahaziah's death and ends around -835 BCE with her overthrow by Jehoiada. The location is Judah, specifically in and around Jerusalem.\n</think>\n\nThe play \"Athalie\" by Jean Racine is based on biblical events from the Old Testament, particularly 2 Kings and 2 Chronicles. These events occurred during the reign of Athaliah in the Kingdom of Judah, which was around the late 9th century BCE. The setting is primarily in Jerusalem, where Athaliah ruled and where the tragic events unfold.\n\n\n{\n    \"period\": \"Ancient Near East\",\n    \"period_reasoning\": \"The play is based on biblical accounts from the Old Testament, specifically events involving King Ahaziah of Judah and his mother Athaliah, which occurred in the late 9th century BCE.\",\n    \"timeframe_start\": \"-842\",\n    \"timeframe_end\": \"-835\",\n    \"location\": \"Judah\",\n    \"location_reasoning\": \"The action takes place in the Kingdom of Judah, centered around Jerusalem, as described in the biblical narrative upon which the play is based.\",\n    \"location_qid\": \"Q1249\"\n}",
