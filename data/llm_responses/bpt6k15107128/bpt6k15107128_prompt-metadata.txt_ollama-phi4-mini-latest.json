  "response": "Based on Jean Racine's title and subtitle, it's clear that this particular work is based upon a story from Holy Scripture. In other words it must have biblical origins.\nSince there are many stories in Bible which can fit with Athalie as its main storyline (Athalie was King of Israel), we can't exactly pinpoint the historical period or location without any more specific information about what part of scripture Racine took inspiration for this play.\n\nHowever, it's safe to say that it might be set around some time close to when Jesus Christ lived in Jerusalem. In other words somewhere between 5 B.C.E and A.D. 4.\nWe don't have enough info however as there are several possibilities; e.g., Athalie could also refer to the Queen of Moab (Athalie was a sister of King Saul).\n\n\n{\n    \"period\": \"Historical period in which the play could have taken place\",\n    \"timeframe_start\": \"-5 C.E.\",\n    \"timeend\": \"+4 B.C.\",\n    \"location\": None,\n    \"location_qid\": null\n}\n\n\nNote: Although it's impossible to accurately pinpoint a time and/or location based on this information alone, I still included the possible range because it can be argued that Athalie was either set during King Saul's reign (around 1010-1005 B.C.E.) or after his death which happened around A.D. 4.\n\nNote: There are also several other possibilities such as setting it in Greece at some point prior to its destruction by Alexander the Great, etc., so it's impossible for us to accurately determine historical period and/or location from this information alone.",
