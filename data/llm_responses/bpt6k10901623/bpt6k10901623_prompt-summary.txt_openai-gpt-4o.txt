    "period": "Early modern period",
    "period_reasoning": "The play is set in the context of a royal court and involves themes of adultery, loyalty, and execution orders, which are characteristic of early modern European royal and noble conflicts. The presence of a character named 'LE ROY' (The King) and the mention of a prince further support this setting. This aligns with the early modern period, roughly covering the Renaissance to the early Enlightenment.",
