Additionally, there are no precise dates given for this era; thus it cannot be narrowed down further with confidence based on provided metadata alone.\n\n- \"metadata\": {\n  - \"author\": Rayssiguier,\n  - \"title\": Alidor et Oronte\n  - \"publication_date\": 1636 (This indicates the play was published in 1636, which falls within a specific decade rather than an exact year but does not indicate if it happened at that time or later.)\n- There are no explicit details about when events took place historically; we can only infer from its publication date.\n- The context mentions places such as \"Angleterre\" (England), France (\"France\"), and Prance, which suggests the play's action could involve any of these modern-day countries. Without a specific time marker for where it was performed or first produced in those locations within their historical timeline that matches with 1636 publication date.\n- Therefore there is not enough precise information to identify exact periods nor location beyond general European context during XVII century.\n\nThis shows the importance and need for more detailed contextual data related explicitly historic events linked directly correlating timeframes.",
