The mention of 'Pluton' (Pluto in Roman mythology) suggests classical elements. The publication in 1656 falls within the period of French neoclassical theatre, which often drew inspiration from ancient Greek and Roman stories. Furthermore, the name 'Magus' in the title could refer to Persian priests or wise men that were known in the Roman world.\",\n    \"timeframe_start\": \"0001\",\n    \"timeframe_end\": \"0500\",\n    \"location\": \"Roman Empire\",\n    \"location_reasoning\": \"While France is mentioned once, it appears to be used in a comparative sense ('C'est un brave valet, s'il y en a en France') rather than indicating the setting. The presence of characters with classical names, the mention of Pluton (Roman god of the underworld), and the title referring to a 'Magus' (associated with the eastern parts of the Roman Empire) suggest a Roman setting. The fact this is a 17th-century French play labeled as a 'tragi-com\u00e9die' further supports the likelihood of a classical Roman setting, as French neoclassical drama often used Roman settings.\",\n    \"location_qid\": \"Q2277\"\n}",
