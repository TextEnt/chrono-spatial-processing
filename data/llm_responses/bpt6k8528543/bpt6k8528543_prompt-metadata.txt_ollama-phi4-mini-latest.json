Since there is no indication of a specific location within this metadata snippet we have to default all values related to time-period or geographical identification (location) as `None`.\n\nThe reasoning provided in 'period_reasoning' will explain why these assumptions were made but also highlight the lack of information for concrete conclusions.\n\n\n{\n    \"period\": None,\n    \"period_reasoning\": \"Based on publication date and play title, it could be inferred that this is a 17th-century French Renaissance work.
