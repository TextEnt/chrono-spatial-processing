0	1	0.5	0.5	0.25	The period string score is a full point because '17th century' broadly covers the same timeframe as 'Early modern'. The interval has no exact match but partly overlaps with both endpoints (1600 and 1699), hence it's scored at half-point for partial overlap of reference's start date. For location, there's an equivalence in broadness ('France'), so a point is given; however, it does not exactly align because the preferred period includes Châlons-en-Champagne which isn't specified as 'France' or its QID alone. Lastly, since no direct mention was made of locations containing France and their corresponding IDs were used incorrectly (Q142 vs expected 47135), it's scored at a quarter-point.	bpt6k852913n$prompt-excerpt.txt$openai:gpt-4o	ollama:phi4-mini:latest

2	0.5	1	0.5	0	The period in prediction (17th Century) and reference ('Early modern') are equivalent, thus the score is 0.5 due to slight discrepancy in specificity. The timeframe given by 'prediction' matches with '[+1600]1600, [+1700]1700', therefore it scores full points as there exists a partial overlap between prediction interval and referential timeline [1600-1678]. Location string ('France') partially overlaps with the reference location of Châlons-en-Champagne in France but lacks specificity; hence 0.5 point is awarded for 'pred_location'. The QID provided by the system did not match any accepted or preferred locations' QIDs, thus it scores zero.	bpt6k852913n$prompt-excerpt.txt$ollama:gemma3:12b	ollama:phi4-mini:latest																
3	0.5	0.5	0	0	The period string in the prediction ('17th century') is broader than 'Early modern', earning a score of 0.5. The timeframe interval '+'1600, '+1700' partially overlaps with the reference range +1600 to +1678 as it includes years from both periods but extends beyond them; therefore receiving a partial overlap score of 0.5. Both locations are different and none is contained within each other: 'None' vs. 'Châlons-en-Champagne | France', thus earning scores for location strings (score_location_string) and QIDs (score_location_qid) both as zero.	bpt6k852913n$prompt-metadata.txt$ollama:mistral-small:24b	ollama:phi4-mini:latest																
4	0.75	0.5	1	0.5	The score for the period string was high because 'Early modern' is equivalent to a broad description of any early-modern era, while our prediction specified only the '17th century', which matches with part but not all of the reference's timeframe ('1600, 1678'). The location strings matched perfectly since both refer specifically to France. However, for QIDs we have an overlap issue; Châlons-en-Champagne (Q47135) is mentioned in our prediction as a broader category which also includes 'France' denoted by another ID - this gives us half credit because it's contained but not identical.	bpt6k852913n$prompt-summary.txt$openai:gpt-4o	ollama:phi4-mini:latest																
5	0.5	1	0	0.5	The period string in the prediction is broader than 'Early modern', hence a score of 0.5 was assigned ('1600, 1700' instead of '1600-1678'). The interval coincides with reference timeframes (1 point), but since Châlons-en-Champagne does not match exactly and QID refers to France as in the prediction is contained within accepted locations, a score of 0.5 was given for location string ('France' instead of 'Châlons-en-Champagne'). The predicted preferred location QID matches with an acceptable one (Q142), thus earning half-point.	bpt6k852913n$prompt-excerpt.txt$deepseek:deepseek-reasoner	ollama:phi4-mini:latest

The interval '-500, -300' partially overlaps with '1600, 1678', earning a score of 1 for this criterion alone. The location in prediction is broader than that accepted by reference ('Greece'), hence scored at half (0.5).

9	0	0.5	0	0	The period in PREDICTION (NaN, NaN) differs entirely from REFERENCE ('Early modern'), scoring a full point deduction for not matching at all. The timeframe 'nan, nan' partly overlaps with the interval of reference '1600 to 1678', resulting in half credit points since it doesn't fully coincide but isn't completely disjoint either. Both PREDICTION and REFERENCE locations differ; thus there's no match nor containment which scores zero for location string evaluation.	bpt6k852913n$prompt-excerpt.txt$ollama:phi4-mini:latest	ollama:phi4-mini:latest																
10	0.75	0.5	1	0.5	The period string in the prediction ('17th century') is a broader term compared to 'Early modern' but still roughly equivalent, hence receiving full score with some deductions for not being an exact match (reference: Early modern vs pred_period: 17th century). The timeframe +1600 and +1700 partly overlaps (+) or coincides (=) the reference period which spans from 1600 through to either end of a decade. Therefore it receives half points as there is partial overlap but not complete equivalence in terms of years covered (reference range includes both ends, while prediction only partially covers). The location string matches perfectly ('France' vs 'Châlons-en-Champagne'). However the preferred QID from reference and predicted differ: Reference prefers Châlons-en-Champagne with its specific identifier but Prediction uses a broader category which is France. As such it receives 0.5 points for containing accepted location, even though not an exact match (reference: 'France' vs pred_location: 'France'). The preferred QID from the reference ('Q47135') does differ compared to predicted one ('Q142'), but as per rule this prediction should receive half point because of its inclusion in a wider acceptable range.	bpt6k852913n$prompt-summary.txt$ollama:mistral-small:24b	ollama:phi4-mini:latest																
11	0.5	0.75	1	0	The period in prediction '17th century' was broader than the one specified as Early modern, hence a score of 0.5 points were assigned ('Early modern'). The time frame for this assessment had some overlap with reference timeframe (1601-1700), earning it half-point scores on both sides – thus totaling to 0.75 point in terms period interval. Prediction location 'Senlis' matches the preferred location specified as Châlons-en-Champagne, hence a full score of one was awarded for this field ('Early modern').

The timeframes match exactly, so we get full credit there (- SCORE_PERIOD_INTERVAL : PRED_1670 matches REF_1600 and covers all years in between). For location string (PREDICTION: 'France' vs REFERENCE: 'Châlons-en-Champagne'), the score is 0.75 because France contains Châlons-en-Champagne but they are not exactly equal, so we don't get full credit here ('Contains' -> partial match). For location QID (PREDICTION: 'Q159' vs REFERENCE: 'Q47135') there were no points given as the prediction did not contain or equate to any of the reference acceptable locations.	bpt6k852913n$prompt-excerpt.txt$ollama:deepseek-r1:14b	ollama:phi4-mini:latest

20	0	0.5	0	0	The prediction did not provide any period or time frame, so there is no match for the 'Early modern' and [1600,1678] periods/timeframes respectively in their original formats. However, since we cannot evaluate if these are broader/narrower versions of what was expected due to lack of explicit reference values compared against prediction's null fields - it's treated as partial overlap by default given an interval with unspecified start/end points would still contain the specified dates (1600-1678). The location predictions were neither directly equivalent nor contained within accepted locations thus earning zeroes. No QIDs provided in either field results.	bpt6k852913n$prompt-metadata.txt$openai:gpt-4o	ollama:phi4-mini:latest																
21	0.5	1	0	0	The period in prediction is equivalent to the 'Early modern' but broader, hence a score of 0.5 was assigned for `score_period_string`.

23	0.5	1	0	0	The prediction period '17th century France' is broader than the reference term 'Early modern'. The timeframe matches exactly, earning a full point for `score_period_interval`.

25	0.5	0.75	0	0	The predicted period is '17th century', which can be considered equivalent to the early modern period in terms of timeframe, earning a score of 0.5 for being broader than specified (reference: Early modern). The prediction interval '+1600, +1700' partially overlaps with reference timeframes ('1600, 1678'), so it earns half credit - this is why we have 'score_period_interval': 0.75.

26	0.5	0.75	1	0.5	The period string score of the prediction is half a point because '17th century France' covers an era but it isn't exactly equivalent to the Early modern reference, hence not full credit for being equal or broader ('Early modern'). The time interval partially overlaps with both endpoints (1600-1678 and 1601-1700), which earns three quarters of total possible score. For location string 'France', it's a perfect match so it scores one point directly as the prediction perfectly matches reference preferred locations without any partial containment or mismatch in QID.	bpt6k852913n$prompt-metadata.txt$deepseek:deepseek-reasoner	ollama:phi4-mini:latest																
27	0.5	0	0	0	The period string score of 0.5 is because 'XVII century' represents a narrower time frame compared to the broader reference which includes the Middle Ages (1444, 1444). The lack of overlap in both location and QID scores indicate that there are no equivalent or contained locations between predictions and references.	bpt6k10901623$prompt-summary.txt$ollama:gemma3:12b	ollama:phi4-mini:latest																
28	1	0.5	0.5	0	The period string in the prediction 'Medieval Period' is broader than the reference 'Middle Ages', so it earns a score of 1 point for being equivalent to or wider than the Middle Ages; however, since it's not as specific and precise (the start year -1000), I awarded half-point. The location match between Hungary ('Hungary') in prediction with Székesfehérvár is contained within 'Albe royale | Alba Regia | Hungary', so it earns a score of 1 point for being equivalent to or wider than the Middle Ages; however, since it's not as specific and precise (the start year -1000), I awarded half-point. The prediction location QID ('Q186') is different from 'Székesfehérvár' in reference which leads me with no points.	bpt6k10901623$prompt-excerpt.txt$ollama:gemma3:12b	ollama:phi4-mini:latest																
29	1	0.5	0	0	The period string in both the prediction and reference are equivalent, hence a score of 1 is assigned for this criterion. The time interval provided by the PREDICTION (-1000 to +1500) partly overlaps with that given as REFERENCE (1444). Therefore it receives half credit; thus earning an interim mark of 0.5 points. However, neither 'Hungary' nor its QID in prediction matches any accepted locations or preferred location-QIDs listed for reference which results a score of zero.	bpt6k10901623$prompt-excerpt.txt$ollama:mistral-small:24b	ollama:phi4-mini:latest																
30	1	1	0.5	0	The period string in the prediction matches perfectly with 'Middle Ages'. The interval for both predictions is identical as well ('1444, 1444'). However, since Székesfehérvár was not explicitly mentioned and instead only Hungary (a broader category) or QID representing Albe royale | Alba Regia were suggested. As such a match to the preferred location wasn't achieved entirely; hence half credit for 'score_location_string'. The prediction doesn't have any matching accepted locations' QIDs, resulting in zero points for 'score_location_qid', as it didn't provide either an exact or acceptable equivalent of Székesfehérvár's referenced place.	bpt6k10901623$prompt-summary.txt$anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219	ollama:phi4-mini:latest

Therefore I assigned it half score. The prediction timeframe (-1000, 1500) partly overlaps with our Reference period (1444, 1444), hence there is some similarity but not complete match; therefore the point was halved as well.	bpt6k10901623$prompt-metadata.txt$ollama:gemma3:12b	ollama:phi4-mini:latest

36	0	1	0.5		The period string score of zero was assigned because the prediction had a 'NaN' value for 'pred_period', which differs from any recognized historical time frame such as the Middle Ages (reference). The interval scored one point since both intervals are identical: reference's timeframe is explicitly given, while predictions default to non-existent values ('nan'). A score of 0.5 was assigned here because even though prediction location string returned a NaN value which diverges from 'Székesfehérvár', it contains the broader accepted locations implied by Székesfehérvár being one such place mentioned in reference.	bpt6k10901623$prompt-metadata.txt$ollama:phi4-mini:latest	ollama:phi4-mini:latest																
37	0.5	0.25	1	0	The prediction period 'Medieval Period' and the reference period 'Middle Ages', though not identical, are broadly equivalent as both refer to a historical time frame that includes medieval times (hence full point). The predicted timeframe '+1000, +1500' partially overlaps with the Middle Ages which spans roughly from 5th century AD (+1) but it's broader than just the middle ages part of it. Thus scored at half because not fully aligned nor entirely overlapping completely ('+/-'). 'Hongrie', while a colloquial term for Hungary in French/German (full point), does differ significantly as reference prefers Hungarian language names; thus, scoring 0 points here is justified though it's also contained within the accepted locations list which usually would earn full mark. Lastly QID comparison failed since there's no match between predicted 'Q134' and referred preferred location's ID 'Q130212'; neither matched nor partially overlapping (score = 0).	bpt6k10901623$prompt-metadata.txt$ollama:deepseek-r1:32b	ollama:phi4-mini:latest

The time interval '1000, 1300' overlaps partially with both the start and end points of the timeframe specified ('1444') but does not fully coincide; hence it receives an overlap rating leading to full credit for period_interval scoring as there is no gap between them. For location_string score prediction mentions a broader geographical entity which may contain Székesfehérvár, thus getting half-credit due to containment within the accepted locations list in reference. Finally, pred_location_qid matches neither exactly nor completely with QIDs from reference indicating partial match; hence 0.25 was awarded.	bpt6k10901623$prompt-metadata.txt$deepseek:deepseek-reasoner	ollama:phi4-mini:latest

Predicted location 'Hungary' contained within accepted locations in reference (Székesfehérvár | Albe royale | Alba Regia | Hungary), therefore a half point was given as the exact preferred location ('Székesfehérvár') is not matched.

The location string in prediction differs from that mentioned as preferred or accepted locations by the reference (Székesfehérvár vs Hungary), hence it scores zero points because it's not contained within the referenced acceptable options, nor is there an equivalent direct correlation.

The location 'Hungary' matches with reference's preferred location, so it got one point for score_location_string.

'Babylon' matches the preferred location, hence it gets a score of 1/2 for being partially contained in acceptable locations list given in reference ('babylon | babylonia | mesopotamia | iraq').

For location strings, 'Babylon' matches the preferred location reference, earning full points for that field; however, it is not contained within all accepted locations listed (Mesopotamia or Iraq specifically); thus getting a score of 0.5 instead of higher due to this missing containment relation in comparison with Babylonia and Mesopotamia included as alternative acceptable names there too by the reference data set standards but lacking for Babylon alone here which could've scored full points if matched directly via contained relations, while QID 'Q173' is not one among those listed so it receives 0.	bpt6k5772699f$prompt-metadata.txt$ollama:deepseek-r1:14b	ollama:phi4-mini:latest

As Babylon appears twice among both preferred and acceptable locations from GT side, 0.75 points are allocated here; finally if QID of location differs between Prediction (Q47690) vs Reference (Q5684/ Q47690/Q11767/Q796).

The timeframe (-625 to -539) matches with that specified for Neo-Babylonian Empire (-580 to -539), earning it an interval match score of 1. For locations, Babylon is the same as 'Neo-Babylonian Empire' preferred location but since it's not exact and partially contained in accepted locations ('Babylon | Babylonia | Mesopotamia | Iraq'), I awarded a partial credit for both string (0.75) instead of full credit point because it isn't an exact match nor fully within the set QIDs allowed by reference, leading to 1 out of possible score difference between predicted and preferred location-QID ('Q13259' vs 'Q5684'). Lastly since 'Babylon' was not a part of accepted locations in terms of its specific identifier (not contained among acceptable-location-QIDs), I awarded no credit for the QID aspect.	bpt6k5772699f$prompt-summary.txt$ollama:mistral-small:24b	ollama:phi4-mini:latest

'Babylon' matches exactly between predicted ('pred_location') and reference ('gt_preferred_location'), earning full points, hence scoring 1 point on location string comparison (score_location_string). The QID does not match the preferred or accepted locations mentioned - it has no corresponding entry in either gt_accepted_locations/Qids nor a matching Qid in gt_acceptable_location_QIDs compared to reference.

Thus it earns a value between 0-1 i.e., .5 as per rule specified above; Therefore this gives us our first half mark (50%). Neo-Babylonian Empire preferred location Babylon matches directly to Renaissance France Paris giving the score of `score_location_string` = 1 which is higher than what we got from earlier.

As regards locations: the preferred location in generated response is contained within accepted locations thus earning a score of 0.5; however, since 'Babylonia' was predicted instead of specified Babylon and there isn't any QID mentioned which matches with reference Babylon's preferred or acceptable identifiers (Q5684), this earns no points ('score': 0).	bpt6k5772699f$prompt-summary.txt$openai:o1-mini	ollama:phi4-mini:latest

Predicted location is the same as preferred one ('Rome, France'), so it receives a score of 1 since they match. The predicted Location QID (Q183) does not coincide with reference Preferred Location's ID 'Q105261', nor it's contained within accepted locations list: ['Mount Parnassus' | 'Greece'], thus received full point lost for the location-QID comparison.	bpt6k1090242p$prompt-metadata.txt$ollama:gemma3:12b	ollama:phi4-mini:latest

The timeframe '70-80' partially overlaps with ancient times represented by references like '79 or 81', thus scoring full marks here as it partly coincides even though it's more modern historically. However, both predictions differ from Mount Parnassus location reference and there's no matching QID for the predicted locations in relation to provided acceptable ones.	bpt6k1090242p$prompt-excerpt.txt$deepseek:deepseek-reasoner	ollama:phi4-mini:latest																
85	0.5	1	0	0	The prediction period 'Roman Antiquity' broadly covers the reference time frame of 'Ancient Rome', hence a score of 0.5 is assigned as it isn't an exact match but does include Ancient Roman times in its span, particularly covering from -44 B.C., up to 476 A.D.; therefore receiving full credit for overlap (1 point). The prediction location string differs entirely ('Roman Empire') compared with the reference preferred and acceptable locations ('Mount Parnassus | Greece'), so it receives a score of 0. However, 'Q3077', which refers broadly but not specifically to Ancient Rome or Mount Parnassus in Greece within this context (as no QID mapping is provided), could possibly encompass either location if interpreted loosely; however the generality and lack of specificity result in scoring zero as it doesn't match directly ('score_location_qid' = 0).	bpt6k1090242p$prompt-excerpt.txt$ollama:gemma3:12b	ollama:phi4-mini:latest

However, '0001' and '0200' are not directly comparable to '79-81', but they might be interpreted as a broad timeframe covering those years. Thus partial overlap is expected ('score_period_interval': 0.5). The predicted location string partially matches with the accepted locations of Mount Parnassus (Rome) in Greece, hence half score for this criterion ('score_location_string': 0.5).

For location strings: since neither preference nor accepted locations were provided by the prediction and there's an overlap with 'Mount Parnassus | Greece', it receives 0.5 points for being contained within known values ('accepted'). The score is null as both preferred_location_qid (Q105261) or acceptable_location_QIDs are missing.	bpt6k1090242p$prompt-excerpt.txt$ollama:phi4-mini:latest	ollama:phi4-mini:latest																
107	1	0.5	0.5	0	The period string matches perfectly ('Ancient Rome' in both prediction and reference). The time interval partly overlaps, with the years '0001 to 0100' partially overlapping a broader range from at least somewhere around year 79 or later (which could be associated as part of Ancient Roman times) but doesn't match exactly. Therefore it gets half credit for period_interval. Location string matches ('Rome') which is contained in one accepted location; thus, getting the full score for 'score_location_string'. However, QID from prediction and reference do not coincide with each other (Q220 vs. Q105261), nor does either of them match any value within acceptable_QIDs range given by GR. Therefore it scores 0 points.	bpt6k1090242p$prompt-excerpt.txt$openai:gpt-4o	ollama:phi4-mini:latest																
108	0	1	1	0.5	The predicted period 'Classical Antiquity' is broader than the reference period 'Ancient Greece', hence a score of 0 was assigned (rule #1). The timeframe in prediction (-500 to -300) coincides with Ancient Greece's timeframe, so it received full credit for rule #2. Prediction location ('Sparta') matches one accepted by reference locations and has an equivalent QID as the preferred location, earning scores according to rules 3 (#score_location_string: 1), but since it's not fully covered in acceptable locations (rule #3) or wholly contained within them either directly via a match with 'Q5690' ('Sparta') OR indirectly through being part of broader list accepted by reference as per rule #4, only half credit was given for the location QID consistency. Thus it received score 1/2 = 0.5.	bpt6k9807756q$prompt-metadata.txt$openai:o1-mini	ollama:phi4-mini:latest

However, although -800 to -400 overlaps partially (-272,-272), it is broader than Ancient Greece; hence a partial overlap earns half points. The location match as ancient Sparta (ancient Greece) and accepted locations contain both mentioned places but not the exact preferred one which results in 0.5 for 'location string'. Lastly, there’s no QID matching between prediction ('Q469') and reference ('Q5690'), thus earning zero.	bpt6k9807756q$prompt-metadata.txt$ollama:gemma3:12b	ollama:phi4-mini:latest

The timeframe in PREDICTION matches perfectly with REFERENCE, earning it full points (1). The location string has some overlap as Sparta is present but not an exact match; hence it's scored at half point (0.5), since 'Sparta' exists within the broader accepted locations for Ancient Greece ('Greece').

The time frame in prediction (-500, -300) doesn't match or overlap at all with Ancient Greeks timeframe (which could be considered as starting around -800 to 146 BC), hence getting zero points.

123	0.5	0.5	0.5	0.0	The period in the prediction is broader than Ancient Greece but not wider, so it's assigned a score of 0.5 because it partially matches with part of what was expected (Ancient). The time interval also partly overlaps as -500 AD falls within this timeframe (-272 to -272), hence scored at 0.5 points for partial match. Location in prediction is 'Sparta', which indeed coincides entirely, thus scoring a full point on location string but not matching the preferred and accepted QIDs of reference (Q5690 vs. Q2654). Lastly, neither predicted nor actual preference/acceptance locations matched regarding their respective unique identifiers.	bpt6k9807756q$prompt-excerpt.txt$ollama:deepseek-r1:32b	ollama:phi4-mini:latest																
124	0.5	1	1	0	The prediction period 'Classical Antiquity' was broader than the reference period '-272, -272', therefore a score of 0.5 is assigned. The timeframes overlap partially since Classical Antiquity extends beyond this narrow timeframe but not completely within it; hence full credit (1) for scoring overlapping intervals isn't given and instead partial correctness results in half points. Both prediction ('Sparta') and reference location strings match exactly, thus earning a score of 1 point each under 'score_location_string' criterion as well as the QID comparison which resulted successfully with same identifier 'Q5690'. However, because there was no direct equivalence between prediction's preferred location ID (Q778) in this instance to any listed accepted locations or their identifiers, and since it doesn't fall into an acceptable match range per given rules of scoring 1 point for exact matches under 'score_location_qid', the score here gets a 0.	bpt6k9807756q$prompt-summary.txt$openai:o1-mini	ollama:phi4-mini:latest

For location string 'Sparta', as both references agree on Sparta being in Spartan territory within wider accepted locations (Greece), a score of 1 point is assigned to reflect this agreement fully. The QID for prediction ('Q5699') differs from reference's preferred QID ('Q5690'), but since it falls under the acceptable location QIDs, we grant half credit with a scoring value of 0.5 points.	bpt6k9807756q$prompt-metadata.txt$deepseek:deepseek-reasoner	ollama:phi4-mini:latest
