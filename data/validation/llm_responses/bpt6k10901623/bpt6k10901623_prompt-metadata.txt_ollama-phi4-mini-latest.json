Since no specific dates are given for this play or its author's lifespan within the JSON object provided:\n\n- `period`: The historical period could be around late Renaissance to early Baroque era since it is from an author who wrote during these periods and considering Fran\u00e7ois de Boisrobert's activity.\n  \n- `timeframe_start` would then likely range somewhere in 1580, as this marks a general start for the later part of the Renaissance (but can go back further depending on when his activities started).\n\n- The end value (`timeframe_end`) could be set around late Baroque period which is often regarded to have ended by mid-18th century. Therefore it might range until 1750.\n\nIn absence of a location within metadata, we would not assume the play's setting:\n\n\n{\n    \"period\": \"Late Renaissance / Early Baroque era\",\n    \"period_reasoning\": \"The title suggests Fran\u00e7ois de Boisrobert was active during late Renaissance to early Baroque period (1580-1750)\",\n    \"timeframe_start\": \"-1580\",  // assuming the author started around this time\n    \"timeframe_end\": \"1750\",\n    \"location\": None,\n    \"location_reasoning\": \"The metadata provided does not include specific information about a location.\",\n    \"location_qid\": null\n}",
