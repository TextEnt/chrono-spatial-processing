The presence of Amurat (likely referring to an Ottoman ruler) who is 'press\u00e9 de passer en Asie' (rushing to cross to Asia) suggests a medieval setting during Ottoman expansion. The themes of royal intrigue, adultery accusations against a queen, and court politics are consistent with medieval dramas.\",\n    \"timeframe_start\": \"1000\",\n    \"timeframe_end\": \"1500\",\n    \"location\": \"Hungary\",\n    \"location_reasoning\": \"The title explicitly states 'Th\u00e9odore, Reyne de Hongrie' (Theodore, Queen of Hungary), indicating Hungary as the primary setting.
