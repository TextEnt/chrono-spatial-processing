The term 'Reyne' also suggests French royalty and nobility, which implies that the play takes place in Europe.\",\n  \"location_qid\": null\n}\n\n\nI chose to use France for my prediction because this was likely one of the countries where the author grew up or worked; however, I could have used a different European country. I did not choose Germany as it is less related than others due to its geographical distance from France and cultural differences in language and literature during that period.\n\nIf you change your mind about using any other values for `timeframe_start`, `timeframe_end` or the location of this play, please let me know; my response could still be valid.",
