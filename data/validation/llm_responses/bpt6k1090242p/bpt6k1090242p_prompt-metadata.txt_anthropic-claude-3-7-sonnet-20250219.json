The mention of 'Berenices' in the subtitle is likely referring to Berenice of Cilicia, a Jewish client queen who had a relationship with Titus before he became emperor. This is a known historical relationship that was the subject of Racine's tragedy 'B\u00e9r\u00e9nice' (1670) and Corneille's 'Tite et B\u00e9r\u00e9nice' (1670). Given that this 1673 play seems to be a critique or commentary on those works, it would be set during Titus's lifetime.\",\n    \"timeframe_start\": \"0079\",\n    \"timeframe_end\": \"0081\",\n    \"location\": \"Rome\",\n    \"location_reasoning\": \"Since the play appears to be about Emperor Titus (based on the title 'Tite et Titus'), and given that it's likely referencing the relationship between Titus and Berenice which was famously the subject of Racine's tragedy, the setting would most likely be Rome, the capital of the Roman Empire where Titus ruled as emperor.\",\n    \"location_qid\": \"Q220\"\n}",
