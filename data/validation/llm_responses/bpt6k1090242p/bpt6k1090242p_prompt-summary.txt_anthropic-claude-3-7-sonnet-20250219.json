The characters include Titus, Berenice (likely referring to Berenice of Cilicia, a Jewish queen who had a relationship with Titus), and references to Rome. The play seems to be a 17th century French adaptation of this historical relationship.\",\n    \"timeframe_start\": \"79\",\n    \"timeframe_end\": \"81\",\n    \"location\": \"Rome\",\n    \"location_reasoning\": \"Rome is mentioned as one of the top places in the text. Moreover, since the play centers around Titus, who was a Roman Emperor, the setting is likely Rome.
