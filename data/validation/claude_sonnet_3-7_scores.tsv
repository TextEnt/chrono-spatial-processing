Location QID: The prediction QID 'Q13284' differs from the reference QID 'Q5690' and is not in the acceptable QIDs list (0 points).	bpt6k9807756q$prompt-metadata.txt$ollama:gemma3:12b	anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219	1199
68	0.0	0.0	0.0	0.0	All scores are 0 because the prediction contains NaN (Not a Number) values for all fields. The reference indicates 'Ancient Greece' as the period, '-272, -272' as the timeframe, 'Sparta' as the preferred location, and 'Q5690' as the preferred location QID. Since the prediction does not provide any valid values to compare against these reference values, no points can be awarded for any of the criteria.	bpt6k9807756q$prompt-metadata.txt$ollama:phi4-mini:latest	anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219	1139

72	1.0	0.5	1.0	0.0	Period string: Both prediction and reference indicate 'Ancient Greece' (1 point). Period interval: The reference specifies the year -272 specifically, while the prediction gives a broader range (-500 to -324) that doesn't include -272, but they are related periods in Ancient Greece (0.5 points). Location string: Both prediction and reference specify 'Sparta' (1 point). Location QID: The prediction gives 'Q80' while the reference specifies 'Q5690' as preferred QID, and 'Q80' is not listed in acceptable QIDs (0 points).	bpt6k9807756q$prompt-summary.txt$ollama:deepseek-r1:14b	anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219	1184

75	0.5	0.5	1.0	0.0	Period string: 'Ancient Spartan period' is more specific than 'Ancient Greece', so it gets 0.5 as it's narrower than the reference. Period interval: The prediction interval (-650, -371) partially overlaps with the reference interval (-272, -272), as the reference year falls outside the prediction range, so it gets 0.5.
